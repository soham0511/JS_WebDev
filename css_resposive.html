<!-- Responsive design is a way for a web developer to make a website adapt to all the devices and resolutions.

Endless new resolutions and devices are challenging to support separately for a web developer; therefore, responsive design is the best approach to develop a website that can adjust itself according to the screen size.

Responsive design is a necessity and not a luxury anymore! -->
<!-- Various Ways To Achieve Responsive Design :
1.By using rem/vh/vw units over pixels.

2.By using max-width/max-height.

3.Using CSS Media Queries.

4.Setting up the viewport. -->
<!-- em- 
Font-sizes are inherited relative to the parent element.

10em means ten times of the parent element. -->
<!-- rem-
Font-size gets set according to the font-size of the root element.

In general, <html> is the root element.

In rem, "r" stands for "root. -->
<!-- vh- 
It stands for viewport height.

vh is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport height.

Example: Suppose height of the browser is 1000px, so 1vh is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px. -->
<!-- vw-
It stands for viewport width.

Similar to vh, vw is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport width.

Example: Suppose width of the browser is 1000px, so 1vw is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px. -->
